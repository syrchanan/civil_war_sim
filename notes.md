# Conversion to Python from R

## Steps
- Define unit stats and effectiveness coefficients
- Implement Lanchester equations
- Simulate battles between two forces

## General
- make everything oop
    - Army class, Infantry class (artillery & cav eventually)
    - Map/terrain class
    - Battle class

## Organization
- main.py: entry point, runs simulations
- army module: defines Army and Unit classes
- battle module: contains Battle class and Lanchester equations
- utils module: helper functions for calculations and data handling
